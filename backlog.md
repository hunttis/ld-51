# LD-51 stuff to work on

## Must-haves

- [ ] Game name
- [ ] Have several layers for a level
- [ ] Finalize player movement
- [x] Add collectable item
- [ ] Player animation (i.e. add frame logic)
- [ ] Load collectible locations from the map file (make one collectible "object layers" for each platform layer)
- [ ] Remove (and remember) uncollected collectibles when the layer changes
- [x] Start Screen
- [ ] Sounds & Music and a possibility to turn them off
- [ ] Graphics for level and player
- [ ] Game over screen
- [ ] Player death (e.g. when falling out of screen) – Valde working on this
- [ ] Score or time (that gets stored to the start screen?)
- [ ] Player dies if on a square that is in the incoming level

## Nice to have

- [ ] "Interactive" collectable items, e.g. key and lock on different layers
- [ ] More levels
- [ ] (Rotating levels? :-D)
- [ ] Particle effects!
- [ ] Visual hints that the layer you are on is about to vanish/explode
- [ ] Curve function to bring the new level "over the horizon"
